# Learn STM32F3

This is an experimental repository for learning embedded programming with the
STM32F3Discovery development board.

## Board

The STM32F3Discovery is an embedded development board containing a
[STM32F303VCT6](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/stm32f3discovery.html#overview)
microcontroller with an
[ARM Cortex-M4F](https://developer.arm.com/ip-products/processors/cortex-m/cortex-m4)
CPU. The CPU is a single core processor with floating point operation support
and a maximum clock frequency of 72 MHz. The board also contains a second
STM32F103 microcontroller for debugging.

### Specifications

- 256‑Kbyte Flash memory
- 48‑Kbyte RAM

## Languages

The repository is split by experiments with different programming languages.
